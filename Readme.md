# Parking Lot Design:


This repository contains code for object oriented design for a parking lot. Vehicles can be assigned a slot when they enter the lot and space gets freed when they leave the parking lot. 2 classes are created for the task in the ``models.py``. and program can be run to get the output by executing ```main.py```.

## Instructions to run:
Program can be easily set up on your system:

For Linux:
  - Make sure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
  - All the inbuilt libraries are used in the task so no need to install dependencies.
  - Open the ```main.py``` file and write the names of input and output files in the relevant variables.
 
    ```output_file="output.txt"       # output file```
    ```read_input=open("input.txt", "r")  # input file```

  - Execute the following command and output file will be generated.
```sh
$ python3 main.py
```

EDIT:
  - Program is changed so that commandline arguments for input and output file can be given so now you have to execute

```sh
$ python3 main.py <input_file> <output_file>
```


For MacOS:
  - All the steps are going to be same the only requirements for running the task is Python 3
